# meghalaya-soil-analysis
Sure! Here's a smalData analysis project on Meghalaya soil dataset using Python. Explored soil properties, visualized patterns, and derived insights to understand soil quality and characteristics
This project focuses on the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a soil dataset from Meghalaya, India, using Python. The dataset contains measurements related to soil moisture and other parameters across various districts. The objective is to clean the data, perform statistical analysis, and visualize key patterns to better understand the soil conditions across the region.

Key steps involved in the project:

Data Loading and Cleaning: Handled missing values, removed duplicate entries, and cleaned column names for consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Performed detailed statistical summaries, distribution analysis, and correlation studies to explore the characteristics of the dataset.

Visualization: Created various types of visualizations including:

Boxplots showing soil moisture distribution across different districts.

Violin plots highlighting moisture variation and spread.

Line graphs to observe trends of average soil moisture levels over time.

Insights Generation: Identified top districts based on moisture levels and observed seasonal or temporal patterns using date-based analysis.

This analysis helps in understanding regional soil behavior which can be valuable for agriculture, environmental studies, and resource management.
